# Simple Race Timer

This is a truly minimal timer to manually time any small races. 
It's built to survive page refresh, but nothing more.

It's also built to be mobile friendly.

A deployed version of the application is available at [simple-race-timer.vercel.app](https://simple-race-timer.vercel.app/).

Have a good race!

## Overview and Features

The clock let you hit the start button at the right time, and then the timer goes live!
Then, on the finish line, it's only about providing the athlete's race number and record the time.

The reset button is hidden in the settings to avoid missclicks. It will also ask for confirmation.
Also, min and max race numbers can be set to prevent mistakes, if, for example, athlete's race number are only between 100 and 199.
